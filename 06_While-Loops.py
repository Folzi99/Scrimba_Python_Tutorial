## Loops are code that run contiuously until there is some condition that tells it to stop

# This code can be turned into a loop, l
print("1.*Loops are great*")
print("2.**Loops are great**")
print("3.***Loops are great***")
print("4.****Loops are great****")
print("5.*****Loops are great*****")

## Synax of a while loop:
# while condition:
#    code
#    iterator

# Three Loop Questions: (everytime you want to make a loop)
#1. What do I want to repeat?
#  ->
#2. What do I want to change each time?
#  ->
#3. How long should we repeat?
#  ->

## Example:
i=0
while i < 5: # condition
    print("Loops are awesome") # code
    i=i+1 # iteration
